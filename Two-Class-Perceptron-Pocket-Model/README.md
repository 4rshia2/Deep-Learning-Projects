# Perceptron Pocket Model
This directory contains a Python implementation of the Perceptron Pocket model for binary classification. The code is designed to be used with two-dimensional datasets, making it suitable for simple binary classification problems.
# Introduction
The Perceptron Pocket model is a binary classification algorithm used to separate two classes of data points based on their features. This implementation is created using Python and leverages the NumPy and Pandas libraries for data handling and manipulation.
# Results
* The best weights of the Perceptron Pocket model after a specified number of iterations.
* The number of misclassifications on the training dataset.
* The number of misclassifications and accuracy on the test dataset.
* Visualization plots of the datasets and decision boundaries.
